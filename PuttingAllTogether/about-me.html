                <h2>My name is Solomon and living the simple life is what I have chosen.</h2>
                <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought
                that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when i got rid of everything</strong>. I 
                literally put 90% of my possesion in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment,
                and I quit my job.
                </p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it
                    worked.
                </p>
                <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p>Now that I'm living s simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and wore more,
                    and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it
                    </strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site.
